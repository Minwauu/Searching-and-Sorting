- Searching for a particular item in a list or a database is a very common operation in computing.

### Linear search

- The only systematic way of finding out which card is which if it is face down is to look at each card until you find the desired item, (Lily).

- 9 cards would have had to be flipped

- If there are *n* names in a list, what is the *average* number of names that will have to be examined? 

- The **worst case** scenario would be finding the desired item in the last possible search.
